Documentation TODO
================================================================================
	[X] Merge Current LaTeX Documentation into the repository
	
	[ ] Create a README in the root folder:
		- What you need installed:
			- CUDA
			- latex
			- *python
			- Qt / PyQt (specifically version 4)
			- Linux System (for bash scripts)
		- Generating a pdf of the documentation
		- Building simulator
		
	[X] Split the current documentation into multiple files
	[X] Add a Makefile to make the documentation pdf and clean up aftwards.
	[X] Create Hypelinks in the TOC.
	
	[ ] Expand FAQ
		[ ] Supported Versions of CUDA
		[ ] Supported Graphics Cards
		[ ] Unsupported Graphics Cards
		[ ] What is the current performance of the refactored implementation?
		[ ] What other models will be supported?
		[ ] 
	
	[ ] Expand on the Design
		[ ] Run through the current implementation of the LIFModel
			- General form
			- Class Structure
		[ ] Run through the simulation sequence in detail
			- parameter checking
			- xml file import
