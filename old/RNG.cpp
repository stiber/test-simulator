/************************************************************
 RNG.cpp -- Random Number Generator Class

 The following class allows you to create RNG objects that are
 independently seeded upon construction, and thus should produce
 distinct sequences. It is a combination of wrapper and functor
 design patterns: it serves as a wrapper around the C srand() and
 rand() functions, and it has operator() overloaded so that
 instances of this class can act syntactically like function calls
 --- they are function objects. RNGs produce uniformly distributed
 random numbers in the range [0,1].

#include "RNG.h"

using namespace std;

// We want to seed the STL random_shuffle algorithm. Unfortunately,
// the only way to do this is to pass in a random number generator
// object, as the STL currently doesn't provide a way to seed the
// default RNG.


// The constructor seeds the C RNG. Note that this definition assumes
// that the OS provides a /dev/random, kernel-level RNG, which many
// Unix-like OSes do (including Linux and Mac OS X). The kernel-level
// RNG gathers environmental noise from from hardware and uses it to
// create a stream of random bytes which can be read from
// /dev/random. If your OS doesn't provide /dev/random, you will need
// to modify this to use another approach --- such as the current time
// (including seconds). In that case, MAKE SURE YOU USE CONDITIONAL
// COMPILATION DIRECTIVES SO THAT THE CODE BELOW IS STILL COMPILED ON
// OTHER OSES.
