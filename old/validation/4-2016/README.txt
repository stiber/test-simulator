Output from the various test files as produced by the refactor-stable-cuda commit
identified as 3dfd83b37465b926c2ff901ef6ba54dd0d3c57f9. Two different builds
were supported at this time, growth (single-threaded cpu) and growth_cuda (single GPU), and
each have their results in a separate directory.
